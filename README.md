# **Love Maths**

# Overview

A code-along project created as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Web Development Course.  This project is designed to cement the basic concepts of vanilla JavaScript learned in the JS Essentials module and introduce some more complex functionality.

## Development Life Cycle

This section is to provide an brief insight into how the approach to the code structure of the website was expected to work, what changed and why, and then to summarise how the creator would now approach replicating the project.

Commits were made as a minimum at once per tutorial, and these were pushed once a section was complete.

## Technologies Used

### **Languages**
* HTML5 is used to provide the basic structure of the website.
  * About: [HTML5 Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
  * Creator: [W3 Consortium](https://www.w3.org/)
* CSS3 is used to provide most of the styling for the website.
  * About: [CSS3 Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
  * Creator: [W3 Consortium](https://www.w3.org/)
* JavaScript ***ADD TEXT HERE***
  * About: [JavaScript Home](https://www.javascript.com/)

### **Libraries and Frameworks**
* [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) is used to provide the grid functionality for uniform design, responsiveness and to enable the use of modal and hamburger menu.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) are used to provide the typography for the website.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is used to provide the icons for the website.
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) is used to facilitate the modal validation sequence.

### **Tools**
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)/[GitHub](https://github.com/) were used for version control and repository storage.
* [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was the IDE used to write the project.
* [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) were used for specific responsiveness testing and drilling down into bug fixing.
* [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) was used for macro testing and identification of errors for rectification.
* [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to remove any remaining errors in CSS code.
* [W3C HTML Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to remove any remaining errors in HTML code.
* [Responsively](https://responsively.app/) was used to explore responsiveness across various devices.

### **Other Resources**
* [Code Institute Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) was used to set up the repository.

## Deployment

The website was created using [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/). Version control was undertaken by committing to [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and pushing to [GitHub](https://github.com/) using the functions within GitPod.

### **Deployment of the Page**
1. In GitPod, ensure the tree is clean, and all required items have been committed and pushed to the repository in GitHub.
1. Sign in to GitHub.
1. A list of repositories should display on the left of the page. Choose the appropriate repository.
1. From the repository menu, choose Settings.
![GitHub menu snip](assets/readme-images/deploy-1.png)
1. Scroll down the page to find the Pages section.
1. From the first dropdown box, choose the Master branch, then click save.
![GitHub Pages snip](assets/readme-images/deploy-2.png)
1. The page will refresh, and the Pages section now shows a URL for the deployed site.
1. Click the URL to view the deployed website.

### **How to Run the Code Locally**
There are slightly different approaches should you choose to use GitPod to clone the project, or a local IDE.

#### Cloning a Project into GitPod
1. Use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/). *(This can also be undertaken in Firefox)*
1. If you do not already have one, [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
1. Install the [GitPod browser extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki).
1. Restart Chrome.
1. In GitHub, find the [project repository]().
1. From the repository menu, choose the green GitPod button.
![GitPod button snip](assets/readme-images/deploy-3.png)
1. A new GitPod workspace will open containing the project code.

#### Cloning a Project into a Local IDE
1. Navigate to the [GitHub Repository]().
1. Choose the Code dropdown menu, and copy the URL.
![GitHub code download snip](assets/readme-images/deploy-4.png)
1. Open your local IDE and then open a terminal.
1. Set the current working directory to your preferred location for the cloned project.
1. Type in "git clone " followed by the copied URL. Be sure to include a space between git clone and the url, then press enter.
1. The cloned project will be created.

You can find more information on cloning a repository from GitHub [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
